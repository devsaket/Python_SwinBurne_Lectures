# Question 1 : Program to write to display first 10 natural numbers
# This question can be performed by using the concept of Loops
# Loop is basically Iterative statement, which repeats till certain condition
# We use concept of range while using Loop condition.

#print(range(10))
#print(range(0,10))
print(range(1,11,1))

# Next Step is to display the numbers which are in middle
# There are two types of Loops : FOR Loop and While loop

for i in range(1,11,1):
    print(i,end=" ")  
# end = " " is used to display the numbers in same line abd it has default vaule of \n
