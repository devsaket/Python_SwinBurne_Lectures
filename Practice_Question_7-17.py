# Exercise Program 7-7 on topic of list

# Number of employees = 6

# Num_employees = 6

# hours = [0] * Num_employees

# # For each employee's hours worked

# for index in range(6):
#    print("Enter the hours worked by employee",
#    index + 1, ":",  end="")
#    hours[index] = float(input())

# pay_rate= float(input("Enter the hourly pay rate : "))


# for index in range(6):
#     gross_pay = hours[index] * pay_rate
#     print("Gross pay for employee ", index +1, " : $", gross_pay ,sep="")
         

# Similar kind of program when there are 8 employees
# Create list [] for 8 employees

# Num_Employee = 3

# #Create the list for 8 employees

# hours = [0] * 3

# #print(hours)
# # Number of hours for each employee

# for index in range(3):
#     print("Enter the number of hours for employee:" , index+1,":",sep="",  end="")
#     hours[index] = float(input())
# # Calculation of hourly pay rate

# pay_rate = float(input("Enter the pay rate: "))

# #Displaying gross salary for eight employees :

# for index in range(3):
#     gross_pay = hours[index] * pay_rate
#     print("Gross pay for employee:", index+1,"$",format(gross_pay,".2f"))



# a= [0] * 6
# print(a)

# a[0] = "sahil"
# # a.append("sahil")
# print(a)
