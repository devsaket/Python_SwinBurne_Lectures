# Question 9 : Write a program in python to display the pattern like right angle triangle using an asterisk

# for this question we will use FOR LOOP and use repetitive operator


#Method 1
a = int(input(" Enter the number of terms "))

# for i in range(a,0,-1):
#     print("*" *i)

for i in range(1,a+1):
    print("*" *i)

#Method 2 :

# a = int(input(" Enter the number of terms "))
# for i in range(a+1):
#     for j in range(i):
#         print("*",end=" ")
#     print(" ")
